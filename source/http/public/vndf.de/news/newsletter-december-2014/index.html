					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno,
						<em>VNDF</em>'s lead developer and chief newsletter
						engineer. This month, I'm going to talk about the
						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#topic">Inspirations: FTL</a>: In the
							fourth and final installation of the series about
							games that inspire <em>Von Neumann Defense
							Force</em>, I'll talk about a true masterpiece:
							<a
								href="http://www.ftlgame.com/"
								target="blank">
								FTL: Faster Than Light</a>

						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What happened since the last newsletter and what do
							I plan to work on next?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#inothernews">In Other News</a>: Happenings
							from around the web that <em>VNDF</em> aficionados
							might take interest in.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						<em>VNDF</em> in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!

					<h1>Inspirations: FTL</h1>

					<p>
						You might have heard about
						<a
							href="http://www.ftlgame.com/"
							target="_blank">
							FTL</a>
						already, it's a very successful game after all. If you
						haven't, I recommend you clear your schedule before
						trying it. This is the kind of game that will draw you
						in and not let go until you've spent way too many hours
						exploring everything it has to offer. Don't say I didn't
						warn you!
					</p>

					<p>
						FTL is a very different game from what I want <em>Von
						Neumann Defense Force</em> to be. After all, it's a
						<a
							href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike"
							target="_blank">
							rogue-like</a>
						with a strong single-player experience, where
						<em>VNDF</em> attempts to be a multiplayer sandbox
						game. However, FTL does a lot of things right that, in
						my opinion, sandbox games usually do very wrong, and I
						hope I'll be able to learn from that.
					</p>

					<p>
						Every sandbox game I've ever played started out so very
						promising: There is an interesting world for you to
						explore, so many things to do, and many dangers to face.
						It doesn't last, however. After a while, excitement
						turns into boredom and adventure turns into tedium.
						There's still plenty to explore, but nothing to discover
						that looks different from what you've already seen.
					</p>

					<p>
						Not so in FTL: With each playthrough you start a new
						adventure. The game won't let you stand still for long,
						always driving you forward and always pressuring you. It
						forces you to make choices. Not all of those are easy,
						and eventually one of them will be the wrong one. This
						leads to an exciting story with ups and downs. Whether
						you win or lose, in the end you always had an
						interesting adventure, a story worth telling.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em> Von Neumann Defense Force</em> will look nothing
						like FTL does, but I want it to have the same feeling
						of adventure, of players creating their own stories.
						<em>VNDF</em> won't be a game where you run back and
						forth for hours, continually accumulating loot or
						resources. Any attempt to gain something new will
						require you to risk what you already have.
					</p>

					<p>
						In <em>VNDF</em>, you won't be able to climb upwards
						steadily. There will be times when you lose, and that
						might frustrate you, but it will also make your wins
						that much sweeter. When you play <em>Von Neumann Defense
						Force</em> it won't be a smooth ride, but hopefully a
						time worth talking about.
					</p>

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						The weeks leading up to
						<a
							href="/news/newsletter-november-2014"
							target="_blank">
							last month's newsletter</a>
						had been a bit slow. Surely this time around I have some
						better news? Well, kind of.
					</p>

					<p>
						Those last few weeks I've been working like a madman on
						a secret project that might completely change the
						immediate future of <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>.
						It is an experiment that, if it succeeds, might take the
						development into a new direction. I'm still in the
						middle of this, however, and am not yet ready to talk
						about it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Here's what will happen: If the experiment succeeds, I
						will have a big announcement ready for you in next
						month's newsletter. If it fails, I'll have wasted 6
						weeks of development time and will be going back to
						business as usual. One way or another, you'll hear all
						about it right here in one month! Exciting, isn't it?
					</p>

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						As always, I'm going to close the newsletter with some
						space- and gaming-related news from around the Internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>JAXA</strong> has successfully launched the
						<a
							href="http://www.jspec.jaxa.jp/e/activity/hayabusa2.html"
							target="_blank">
							Hayabusa 2</a>
						mission! If everything goes to plan, the craft will
						arrive at its target, the asteroid
						<strong>(162173) 1999 JU3</strong>, in 2018, land there
						and return surface samples back to earth in 2020.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>NASA</strong> has completed a very successful
						first test flight of its new
						<a
							href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/mpcv/"
							target="_blank">
							Orion capsule</a>.
						During the 4-hour flight, the unmanned capsule reached a
						distance of about 5800 kilometers from earth, the
						farthest any human-rated spacecraft has gone since the
						last Apollo mission in 1972! I'm not so sure that this
						really is the first step towards a manned Mars mission,
						but it's certainly exciting that NASA is regaining its
						capability to send humans beyond low Earth orbit.
					</p>

					<p>
						I really like this
						<a
							href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/09/science/space/curiosity-rover-28-months-on-mars.html?_r=0"
							target="_blank">
							visualization of Curiosity's progress</a>
						in its 28 months on Mars. The video at the top is really
						nice!
