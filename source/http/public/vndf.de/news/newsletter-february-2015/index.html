					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno,
						<em>VNDF</em>'s lead developer and chief newsletter
						engineer. This month, I'm going to talk about the
						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#topic">Fun Without Graphics: Dwarf
							Fortress</a>: This month I'm starting a new series!
							Now that <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> is going
							to be a text-based game, I'm going to look into a
							few text-based games, learning how they do things
							and what I can learn from that.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What happened since the last newsletter and what do
							I plan to work on next?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#inothernews">In Other News</a>: Happenings
							from around the web that <em>VNDF</em> aficionados
							might take an interest in.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						<em>VNDF</em> in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						The last few weeks of development have been pretty
						solid. Let's take a look at what my plans where last
						month:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Finish work on the networking infrastructure</li>
						<li>Figure out remaining user interface issues</li>
						<li>
							Deploy new text-based version, so
							<a href="/newsletter">newsletter subscribers</a> can
							access it
						</li>
						<li>Add space flight back into the game</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						I've managed to complete all points beside the last one,
						which is slightly better than I expected.
					</p>

					<p>
						I got the networking work out of the way pretty fast.
						Shortly after sending out the last newsletter, I
						realized that I was being overambitious.  The old
						networking code was certainly crappy and needed to be
						replaced, but I was wasting my time trying to create the
						perfect solution when all I needed was something simple
						that worked.
					</p>

					<p>
						So that's exactly what I did. I scrapped the new
						networking infrastructure and replaced it with the new
						new networking infrastructure. It's not perfect, but it
						works, is reasonably clean, was quick to write and can
						be extended to handle more demanding situations as the
						need arises. Problem solved!
					</p>

					<p>
						Next up was the user interface. This was way more work
						than I expected. There was a large number of details
						that I needed to figure out, both in the way I want the
						interface to work and in how to implement that
						reasonably. I managed to get the existing interface into
						a state I'm pretty happy about. I think the code that
						supports it leaves a lot to be desired, but it's good
						enough for now and can be improved along the way.
					</p>

					<p>
						There's not much to say about the deployment of the new
						version. It's up and running now, and
						<a href="/newsletter">newsletter subscribers</a> can
						access it through the link they got when signing up.
					</p>

					<p>
						But enough talking, let's look at screenshots. Here's
						what the game looked like last month:
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/news/newsletter-february-2015/screenshot-old.png"
						target="_blank">
						<img src="/news/newsletter-february-2015/screenshot-old.png" />
						<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						And this month:
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/news/newsletter-february-2015/screenshot-new.png"
						target="_blank">
						<img src="/news/newsletter-february-2015/screenshot-new.png" />
						<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						Looks pretty similar, but there have been significant
						improvements to the user interface. The list of received
						broadcasts can be scrolled, there are colors to indicate
						what is currently selected and/or active and it works
						a bit better overall.
					</p>

					<p>
						So what's up next?
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							The biggest priority right now is adding more
							features to the game, starting with navigating
							through space. Technical groundwork is important and
							a prerequisite for pretty much everything else, but
							more than anything I need to expand on the actual
							game.
						</li>
						<li>
							There are still a few issues with the user
							interface, but those are smaller and can be done on
							the side. Not sure how much I'll do here beyond
							what's absolutely necessary.
						</li>
						<li>
							This is not directly related to the game, but the
							website definitely needs some work. I'm not talking
							about the design (although that could use some work,
							too!), but the behind-the-scenes stuff. That's
							currently just hacked together and causes me more
							and more work the more content I write. I'd also
							like to learn a bit more about who visits the site,
							where they come from and what they do here.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						I don't know yet how much I can get done, especially
						since I'm not sure yet what exactly to do about the
						website. You'll find about it next month, I guess!

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						As always, I'm going to close the newsletter with some
						space- and gaming-related news from around the Internet.
					</p>

					<section>
						<h1>New Pictures of Ceres</h1>

						<p>
							Dawn has shot
							<a
								href="http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/feature_stories/Dawn_getting_closer_views.asp"
								target="_blank">
								some new pictures of Ceres</a>.
							If all goes well, Dawn will have arrived at Ceres by
							the time next month's newsletter arrives in your
							inbox. Very exciting!
						</p>

					<section>
						<h1>Successful Test Flight by ESA</h1>

						<p>
							ESA's Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) has
							<a

								target="_blank">
								completed its test flight</a>.
							IXV is, as the name says, only a testing vehicle,
							but it will hopefully lead to new and interesting
							technology in the future.
