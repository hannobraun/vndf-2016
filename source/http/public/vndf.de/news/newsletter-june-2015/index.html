					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno, VNDF's lead
						developer and chief newsletter engineer.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you haven't noticed, this newsletter is the latest
						yet. Usually, I aim for the 15th, and while a few days
						delay is quite normal, this time I've missed by a whole
						two weeks. The good news is that, compared to last
						month, the pace of development seems to be picking up a
						bit. If everything goes as planned, that trend will
						continue through July.
					</p>

					<p>
						But enough introduction. Here's what's happened since
						the last newsletter:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#cli-improvment">CLI Improvement</a>:
							A small improvement has been made to the
							command-line interface.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#navigation">Navigating Through Space</a>:
							Players can now change the course of their ship.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#server-cleanup">Server Cleanup</a>:
							There has been a big cleanup of the server code.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#comm-ids">Comm Ids Are Gone</a>:
							I've removed the old communication ids that used to
							be generated for each client.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						VNDF in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!

					<h1>CLI Improvement</h1>

					<p>
						Previously, it was kind of hard to tell what was going
						on with the command-line interface, unless you knew
						exactly what had just been typed in. No more! Now the
						commands that were executed are shown with the output.

					<a name="navigation"></a>
					<h1>Navigating Through Space</h1>

					<p>
						The current focus of work is navigating through space.
						Previously, the player's ship would just move slowly to
						the right. I've made the first step towards adding
						support for navigation.
					</p>

					<p>
						With the <code>schedule-maneuver</code> command, the
						player can change the direction of movement. The syntax
						is <code>schedule-maneuver &lt;angle&gt;</code>, where
						<code>&lt;angle&gt;</code> is an angle in degrees, right
						being 0 degrees.
					</p>

				<section>
					<a name="server-cleanup"></a>
					<h1>Server Cleanup</h1>

					<p>
						The addition of the new navigation feature highlighted
						some weaknesses in the structure of the server code. The
						server's architecture had been pretty straight-forward,
						so far, but it was starting to crumble under its own
						weight.
					</p>

					<p>
						A big focus has been to clean up the mess, splitting the
						rather large mass of code into small, self-contained
						modules and rethinking how all of it worked and could be
						improved.
					</p>

					<p>
						I've been doing a lot of this, and it had a very
						positive effect, making the code more maintainable. I
						expect this to be an ongoing concern for a while, as the
						game logic grows more complicated.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a name="comm-ids"></a>
					<h1>Comm Ids Are Gone</h1>

					<p>
						Up until today, a randomly generated identifier (like
						AZX-44FK, or KUF-H5HN) was assigned to every player when
						they logged in. This identifier was displayed with a
						player's broadcast, to make help identify the sender.
					</p>

					<p>
						Unfortunately that feature got in the way of some
						cleanup work and I decided to remove it. In the long
						term, it will be obsolete anyway, as broadcasts will be
						displayed next to the sender's ship (not in a list) and
						players will be able to choose their own names.
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm not sure yet when that glorious future will arrive,
						but until then, the ship's internal entity id is used as
						a placeholder.
					</p>
