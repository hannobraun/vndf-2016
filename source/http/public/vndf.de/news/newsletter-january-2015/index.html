					<h1>A New Direction</h1>

					<p>
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> has always been an
						ambitious project. I knew that from the start. This
						didn't matter much in the beginning, however. Back then
						I was going through a very stressful time and needed a
						side project that allowed me to wind down in the
						evenings. Something I could tinker on just for fun,
						without any expectation for results.
					</p>

					<p>
						A lot has changed since then. Over time, the project
						grew on me and I became much more serious about it.
						Today I am committed to see it through, and this
						commitment has led me to take a critical look at my
						progress. It has become clear to me that something needs
						to change.
					</p>

					<p>
						Since I finished
						<a
							href="/news/newsletter-july-2014/#storysofar"
							target="_blank">
							rewriting the game in Rust</a>,
						a lot has been done, but not nearly enough. At the
						current pace, I'll be done around 2050 and this isn't
						acceptable. I have to face the facts: Without serious
						adjustments to the project scope I will never be able to
						finish.
					</p>

					<p>
						I've been thinking about this for a while, and I have
						figured out a way to make the project more manageable
						without compromising my overall vision. I need to cut as
						much work as I can from the area that has cost most most
						of the effort while mostly being optional at this point:
						3D graphics and related areas like user interface and
						input processing.
					</p>

					<p>
						To get to the point, I've decided to replace the current
						3D interface with a text-based one, that uses as little
						graphics as possible.
					</p>

					<section>
						<h1>What exactly will that look like?</h1>

						<p>
							As much in-game information as possible will be
							represented as text. For example, instead of
							displaying the positions of ships in the vicinity in
							3D space, there will be a list of nearby ships, each
							with their position, direction and distance in text
							form. There will be (at least initially) no mouse
							input. The game will be controlled entirely with the
							keyboard.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>What do you hope to gain from this?</h1>

						<p>
							This will save me a lot of work on something that is
							really not essential right now. Of course, graphics
							are nice to look at, but without actual game play,
							there's honestly not much point in having them.
							There is a lot of work to be done, and the more I
							can delay or even forgo completely, the better the
							chance I can create something fun and meaningful.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>
							Does this mean graphics are gone from the game
							forever?
						</h1>

						<p>
							No. For one, there are a few concepts that I'm not
							sure I can represent in a purely text-based fashion
							(orbits and navigation in general come to mind).
							For these areas, I'll use graphics sparingly and in
							a way that causes as little work as possible.
						</p>

						<p>
							Also, I'd like to add graphics back to the game
							later, as my resources allow. However, I won't spend
							any time on this until I have a game that is a fun
							and engaging, if something somewhat spartan,
							experience.
						</p>
					</section>

					<p>
						So much for the overall vision. In the
						<a href="#update">Development Update</a> I'll tell you
						all about my progress so far.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						In today's <a href="#topic">article</a>, I outlined a
						new direction for <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>'s
						development efforts. After having worked on this for
						almost two months, I had really hoped to be able to
						present some impressive advancements in the gameplay
						department. This was not to be, however, mainly for two
						reasons:
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
							Even though it is much less work than a 3D
							interface, a text-based interface still requires
							some groundwork to be laid. This was more work than
							I had hoped. Not because the code was complicated to
							write, but because finding the right approach for
							the user interface required a bit of
							experimentation.
						</li>
						<li>
							The second (and main) reason is that I decided that
							I'd take this chance to redo the networking
							infrastructure. I did this because I'm interested in
							the work and because I hope to use the resulting
							code and experience for another project I'm working
							on. From <em>VNDF</em>'s perspective, it was
							definitely a dumb move, however, since it added a
							lot of work and provides, for the time being, no
							visible results.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						No matter, I still made some progress, and here's a
						screenshot:
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/news/newsletter-january-2015/screenshot-new.png"
						target="_blank">
						<img src="/news/newsletter-january-2015/screenshot-new.png" />
						<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						As you can see, I added a new feature: Broadcasting
						messages that can be read by other players. This is a
						conveniently simple feature that I could use to test my
						approach to the user interface and the networking code.
						I also think it's very important for the game to have at
						least a very simple communication method from the
						beginning.
					</p>

					<p>
						So what's next? A lot of work is still to do:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							First and foremost, the work on the networking
							infrastructure needs to be finished, mostly because
							it doesn't work right at this point. Once this work
							is done, <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> will
							stand on a much more solid foundation than it did
							before.
						</li>
						<li>
							After that, I still need to figure out some more
							details regarding the new interface. I don't expect
							this to take very long.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once all of this is done, I need to deploy the new
							version to the production server. As you may know,
							the in-development version of the game is already
							running and accessible to
							<a href="/newsletter">newsletter subscribers</a>.
							Not right now, however, since the server still runs
							the old version from before I started my little
							text-based experiment.
						</li>
						<li>
							And finally, we've temporarily lost an important
							feature (besides graphics) with this transition:
							Navigating through space. Once the groundwork is
							laid, this needs to be added back as soon as
							possible.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						All of this is quite a bit of work and I'm not sure how
						much of it I can get done until the next newsletter. I
						hope to at least finish redoing the network code and
						solving the remaining interface issues, however.

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						As always, I'm going to close the newsletter with some
						space- and gaming-related news from around the Internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						After NASA's successful Orion test flight (see
						<a
							href="/news/newsletter-december-2014#inothernews"
							target="_blank">
							December newsletter</a>),
						ISRO has followed suit with the
						<a
							href="http://www.space.com/28114-india-space-capsule-test-flight.html"
							target="_blank">
							successful test of its own launcher and capsule</a>.
						India is shaping up to be an interesting contender in
						space exploration and I'm excited to see what will
						happen over the next few years.
					</p>

					<p>
						As part of the CRS-5 mission to resupply the
						International Space Station, SpaceX has tried to land
						the first stage of the rocket on its
						<a
							href="http://www.spacex.com/media-gallery/detail/125916/4491"
							target="_blank">
							autonomous spaceport drone ship</a>
						that serves as a landing platform in the ocean. Even
						though the media calls this landing attempt a failure,
						it was anything but: They managed to get a supersonic
						rocket back from the edge of space and hit a tiny target
						floating in the middle of the Atlantic. That the rocket
						<a
							href="https://vine.co/v/OjqeYWWpVWK"
							target="_blank">
							blew up in the attempt</a>
						is a detail that can be worked out. I'm really looking
						forward to the next flight. A successful landing and
						reuse of the rocket's first stage would reduce launch
						costs significantly and usher in a new age for space
						exploration.
					</p>

					<p>
						Have you ever wondered how much asteroids are flying
						around in the inner solar system? Even if you haven't, I
						recommend you check out
						<a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJsUDcSc6hE"

						this awesome video</a> about the discovery of asteroids
						in the last few decades.
