					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann

						engineer. This month, I'm going to talk about the
						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#topic">Inspirations: Kerbal Space
							Program</a>: In this second part of our series about
							games that inspired <em>Von Neumann Defense
							Force</em>, I'll take a look at how
							<a
								href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/"
								target="_blank">
							Kerbal Space Program</a> turns difficult game
							mechanics into a lot of fun.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What happened since the last newsletter and what do
							I plan to work on next?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#inothernews">In Other News</a>: Happenings

							might take interest in.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>

					<h1>Inspirations: Kerbal Space Program</h1>

					<p>
						In the September newsletter,
						<a
							href="/news/newsletter-september-2014/"
							target="_blank">I talked about EVE Online</a>
						and how it inspired <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>.
						Today I'd like to talk about a game that inspired
						<em>VNDF</em> in a different, but still very important
						way:
						<a
							href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/"
							target="_blank">Kerbal Space Program</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						The inspiration that EVE Online provided lies at the
						very root of <em>VNDF</em>'s conception. Without its
						influence, I would be working on something else right
						now. The influence of Kerbal Space Program (KSP, for
						short) came much later in the process. I discovered it
						last year, around the same time I started working on
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>, long after I had
						conceived of the initial idea. While EVE inspired
						<em>VNDF</em>'s themes and vision, KSP had a big
						influence on its mechanics.
					</p>

					<p>
						I had been fascinated by gameplay based on orbital
						mechanics for a long time, ever since playing
						<a
							href="http://osmos-game.com/"
							target="_blank">Osmos</a>
						in 2009 or 2010. I worked on a few
						<a
							href="http://files.hannobraun.de/gravity/"
							target="_blank">stupid</a>
						<a
							href="http://files.hannobraun.de/upstart/"
							target="_blank">prototypes</a>
						back in 2011 but never applied the concept to a real
						game. I thought it would be impractical, too complicated
						for most players.
					</p>

					<p>
						Before I played Kerbal Space Program, I imagined <em>Von
						Neumann Defense Force</em> with much simpler mechanics,
						almost arcade-like. KSP taught me that orbital mechanics
						can not only provide a fun and rewarding game
						experience, it also showed me that a game based on them
						can be very successful. It inspired me to be bolder and
						less compromising in my vision, and I believe <em>Von
						Neumann Defense Force</em> will be a better game for it.
					</p>

					<p>
						But there is more that Kerbal Space Program can teach.
						Two elements in particular, that I want to include in
						<em>VNDF</em>, are the high cost of actions and the
						creative freedom in designing your ship's capabilities.
					</p>

					<p>
						In Kerbal Space Program, you can't just fly somewhere on
						a whim. Going to
						<a
							href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Duna"
							target="_blank">Duna</a>
						probably means you won't be going to
						<a
							href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Laythe"
							target="_blank">Laythe</a>,
						at least not without mounting a refueling mission first.
						Landing on a planet might mean you won't have enough
						fuel to go back home afterwards. On the other hand, you
						have huge creative freedom in designing your craft and
						its capabilities, enabling you to make the compromises
						that prepare you for the mission ahead.
					</p>

					<p>
						I want to capture these two elements in <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em>. Ships in <em>VNDF</em> will be on
						a higher technological level than those in KSP, but they
						will still be limited in what they can do. And while
						<em>VNDF</em> won't simulate flight physics in as much
						detail, you will still be able to customize your ship's
						capabilities to a high degree. I believe coupling these
						elements with competitive
						<a
							href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player"
							target="_blank">PvP</a>
						gameplay will make for a tense and rewarding experience.
					</p>

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						The last few weeks have been some of the most productive
						ever for <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>. As a
						reminder, here's what the game looked like a month ago.
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/news/newsletter-october-2014/screenshot-old.png"
						target="_blank"
					>
						<img src="/news/newsletter-october-2014/screenshot-old.png" />
						<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						Last month, I had just added 3D graphics, but there was
						no 3D gameplay yet. The movement of ships was restricted
						to a plane. Consequently, I planned to implement 3D
						movement next and then work on Newtonian mechanics and
						adding a planet. Here's how that ended up.
					</p>

					<a
						class="image"
						href="/news/newsletter-october-2014/screenshot-new.png"
						target="_blank"
					>
						<img src="/news/newsletter-october-2014/screenshot-new.png" />
						<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
					</a>

					<p>
						Lots of changes, as you can see!
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Not one, but two planets, albeit unrealistically
							close to each other.
						</li>
						<li>
							The old grid was replaced by this new blue thing to
							help with orientation. If you have an idea what to
							call it, <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">please
							tell me</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Some helpful text to indicate distance and
							direction.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						In addition to that, there are a few new features that
						are not visible on the screenshot (you can take my word
						for it, or, you know, just
						<a href="/newsletter">subscribe to the newsletter</a>
						and get access to the latest prototype).
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							We have proper physics! No
							<a
								href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFriction"
								target="_blank">space friction</a>,
							no
							<a
								href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAir"
								target="_blank">air in space</a>.
							Navigate space the old-fashioned way, like
							<a
								href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics"
								target="_blank">Newton</a>
							meant you to!
						</li>
						<li>
							Ships are removed from the game when colliding with
							a planet.
						</li>
						<li>
							Which is made more dramatic, since the planets also
							pull you towards them with their gravity.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						All of this is quite nice, but it came with a few
						problems. While the helpful blue thing (as I said,
						please <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">send me your
						suggestions</a> on what to call it) makes it pretty easy
						to judge where you are in relation to other objects, it
						has become pretty much impossible to know which way
						you're facing and where you are going to be next. Fixing
						this by presenting this information better will be the
						priority for the coming weeks.
