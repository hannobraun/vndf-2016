					<h1>VNDF's Vision</h1>

					<p>
						In <a href="/news/newsletter-july-2014/" target="_blank">last month's
						newsletter</a> I talked about the project's past. This
						month, we look at its roots from a different
						perspective: What is the vision behind <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em>? What does the project set out to
						achieve?
					</p>

					<p>
						As you'll see, I'm going to keep this focused on the
						goals themselves, rather than the means to achieve them.
						I've decided to do this for the following reasons:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Features are only a means to an end, while goals
							define the project. Of course the goals will be
							refined over time, but any planned feature I can
							describe now will probably have changed a dozen
							times by the time I actually implement it, if it
							gets implemented at all!
						</li>

						<li>
							While I do have a very concrete picture of what I
							want the game to look like, I don't believe it will
							actually end up looking like this! Most of my ideas
							might be shit. Problem is, I don't know yet which
							ones.
						</li>

						<li>
							Even ignoring the previous points, I don't think now
							is the time to talk about <em>VNDF</em>'s future in
							such detail. This is a big project and it will take
							a long time before it can be realized. I want to get
							you excited about my vision and share the journey
							with you, rather than just make promises that I
							won't be able to deliver on for months or even
							years!
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						But enough with the introduction! Let's take a look at
						the goals, quoted straight from my vision document:
					</p>

					<section>
						<h1>
							Mechanics that make player skill the prime condition
							for success.
						</h1>

						<p>
							There might be
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game" target="_blank">
							RPG</a>-like elements in the game that allow players
							to improve their stats. Or there might not.
							Honestly, I don't know yet. What will definitely be
							possible is to upgrade your ship with better
							equipment, to improve your chances of survival.
						</p>

						<p>
							But no matter what kind of hardware you bring into a
							situation, a savvy veteran player will always get a
							better result than a less skilled player with
							slightly better equipment. Even if the difference in
							equipment is too much to overcome with sheer
							cunning, the unskilled player might still lose their
							superior ship in a situation that the veteran player
							knowingly avoided.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>
							Players that drive everything that is meaningful
							about the game.
						</h1>

						<p>
							I don't know if it's possible to create <em>Von
							Neumann Defense Force</em> as a purely player-driven
							game, a simple sandbox solely guided by the players
							inhabiting it. I don't even know if that's worth
							trying.
						</p>

						<p>
							But while there might well be
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character" target="_blank">
							NPCs</a> in the game, they will be there to enrich
							the experience, not to direct it. <em>Von Neumann
							Defense Force</em> won't feature empires you can
							pledge yourself to, unless those empires have been
							built by other players. If someone is asking you to
							do something for the promise of a reward, that
							someone is going to be another player.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>
							As few arbitrary limitations as possible. Players
							should only be limited by the physics of the game
							world.
						</h1>

						<p>
							I think we can all agree that having your ship blown
							up by an experienced player is not the best
							experience when you've just started the game for the
							first time. So new players need to be protected, but
							what is the best way to do it?
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> will aim to solve
							problem such as this in a way that keeps the game
							world internally consistent. Maybe by spawning new
							players far away from anyone else. Maybe by giving
							players incentives to protect each other. Or maybe
							by just making it really easy to hide.
						</p>

						<p>
							What <em>VNDF</em> won't do is just disable a button
							because using its function is forbidden to you in
							that situation.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>
							No menial tasks. Rule of thumb: If an activity could
							be performed by a bot, it should be automatic.
						</h1>

						<p>
							A lot of games, especially online games, require you
							to
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_%28video_gaming%29" target="_blank">
							grind</a>, if you want to achieve something. <em>Von
							Neumann Defense Force</em> will aim cut out all the
							grinding and replace it with higher-level gameplay.
						</p>

						<p>
							Why should you sit around and spend hours mining
							some asteroid when you could place your automated
							miner, plan its logistics and coordinate its
							protection with other like-minded players?
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>
							A sense of adventure, accompanied by danger. Forward
							movement, forced upon the player by the constraints
							of the environment.
						</h1>

						<p>
							Many games just become boring as you advance through
							them. What started out as an exciting adventure
							turns into work, as you collect more and more stuff
							you didn't really need in the first place.
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> won't let things
							get that far, because it won't let you stand still
							for very long. It will always drive you forward,
							forcing you to make quick decisions that might well
							turn out to be wrong. At some point, the danger will
							catch up to you and you might lose everything.
						</p>

						<p>
							Maybe you will quit the game then and never come
							back. But that's okay. Because while you were there,
							you had fun. And you take with you the memories of
							all the stories your decisions formed, with all
							their ups and downs.
						</p>

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						But enough about visions, dreams and other things that
						don't really exist. What actually happened since the
						last newsletter?
					</p>

					<p>
						Let's start with the work I talked about
						<a href="/news/newsletter-july-2014/" target="_blank">last month</a>:
						Replacing the cheesy sales copy on the website and
						cleaning up my development environment to make me more
						effective. I'm happy to report success on both fronts.
					</p>

					<p>
						I originally started to write a short story for the
						website that tells an adventure as it could happen in
						the game. My goal was to help visitors understand what
						the game is about, while entertaining them at the same
						time. However, writing a short story turned out to be
						much more work than I'd hoped. In the end it turned into
						a huge distraction, so I called it quits and wrote
						<a href="/" target="_blank">a few paragraphs of descriptions</a>, which
						I'm reasonably happy with.
					</p>

					<p>
						There's not a lot to say about the cleanup. It was a bit
						of work, but my turnaround time went from "way too long"
						to "quite reasonable", which has alread been a huge
						help.
					</p>

					<p>
						After those two things were done, I started with the
						next task on my list, which is the graphics code.
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> will be a 3D game,
						but a while ago I decided to switch to a 2D perspective
						during early development to make things easier while I
						work on other parts of the code. This won't work any
						longer, since I plan to work on new features next. If I
						switched back to 3D later, I'd have to redo a lot of
						them, so switching now is definitely better.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the past, the graphics code has been a bit of a pain.
						I'm using a technology called
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL" target="_blank">OpenGL</a>.
						OpenGL is certainly capable of doing everything I need
						it to do, but it's not very pleasant to use, especially
						for a non-expert like me.
					</p>

					<p>
						Fortunately, things have changed since I last worked on
						this stuff, namely a new project
						(<a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs" target="_blank">gfx-rs</a>)
						has appeared that basically wraps OpenGL in an easier to
						use package. This looks very promising and might save me
						quite a bit of time and pain, so I'm evaluating it right
						now.
					</p>

					<p>
						Whether I end up using gfx-rs or not, I'll work on the
						graphics side of things next. If all goes well, I'll be
						able to show off a few screenshots and/or videos next
						month!
					</p>

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						As has become tradition by now (yes, I only need two
						newsletters to establish a tradition), I'll close the
						newsletter with gaming and space-related news from
						around the internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						I already mentioned that the guys from Squad were about
						to release a new version of
						<a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/" target="_blank">Kerbal Space
						Program</a> last month, and now <strong>0.24</strong> is
						actually out. It's quite good. I recommend you play it!
					</p>

					<p>
						Another topic I already mentioned is <strong>New
						Horizons</strong>. It'll be almost a year until it
						arrives, but it has already sent back
						<a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/videos/PR_E12_proper_nosat_3fps.gif" target="_blank">
						awesome pictures of Pluto and its moon Charon</a>. Or
						maybe we should call those two a
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_planet" target="_blank">
						binary planet</a>? Look how Pluto wobbles due to
						Charon's influence!
					</p>

					<p>
						After more than 10 years of travel, ESA's probe <strong>
						Rosetta</strong> has finally
						<a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_arrives_at_comet_destination" target="_blank">
						arrived at its destination</a>, the comet
						67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko! Never before has a spacecraft
						rendezvoused with a comet. In another first, Rosetta
						will attempt to launch a lander in November.
