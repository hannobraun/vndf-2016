					<h1>The Story So Far</h1>

					<p>
						This is the first <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>
						newsletter, which seems like a good occasion to talk
						about the origins of VNDF, how it came to be and what
						happened since then.
					</p>

					<p>
						For many years <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> had
						only been an idea in my head, one I occasionaly talked
						about with friends but otherwise never acted on. All
						this changed in April of 2013 when I finally started to
						work on the project. The first piece of work I finished
						was a document named <em>GOALS</em>, painting the
						project's vision in broad strokes:
					</p>

					<code>
						1. Hello World<br />
						2. ???<br />
						3. Space MMO<br />
					</code>

					<p>
						For those in the audience not familiar with computer
						programming, the first step describes the traditional
						first milestone that almost every software project will
						start out with: A simple program that does nothing more
						than print <em>"Hello, World!"</em> (or something
						equally simplistic) to the screen.
					</p>

					<p>
						I immediately went on to master that first step, and
						while I haven't managed to make anything yet that could
						actually be called
						"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game" target="_blank">MMO</a>",
						I'm proud to report that after almost 15 months of
						off-and-on work and exactly 2799 changes made to the
						project's source code, I am firmly into step 2.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the beginning, <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> was
						written in
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">
						C</a>, a venerable programming language that lacks many
						of the comforts its more modern descendants bring to the
						table, but is unsurpassed in many respects and thus
						still has its place in a lot of programmer's toolboxes.
						In the beginning I made slow but steady progress,
						figuring out how to approach the basic systems required
						by a multiplayer game: Network communication, 3D
						rendering, understanding player input and the like.
						While all of this was great fun, my choice of
						programming language showed its drawbacks: Many basic
						tools that are included with more modern languages are
						not provided by C, so a lot of things that could have
						been easy, required some figuring out on my part.
					</p>

					<p>
						A lot of that changed towards the end of 2013:
						<a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>, another
						programming language which had been on my radar for a
						while was finally approaching a point were it was
						becoming usable for me. Rust is a pretty new language
						that is being developed by
						<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>, the fine
						people that also bring us the Firefox web browser. In
						some ways, it is almost the opposite of C: Where C is
						old and established, Rust is young and unproven.
						However, in constrast to a lot of other programming
						languages that have been developed 	since C appeared in
						the 70's, Rust allows the programmer to control the
						computer very precisely, like C did, but doing so in a
						novel way that is much safer to use, preventing many
						mistakes that C would allow.
					</p>

					<p>
						I decided to bet on Rust and started rewriting <em>Von
						Neumann Defense Force</em> in this new language, a
						process that would take me a few months (I don't
						remember exactly, but I think I was finished around
						February or March 2014). So far I'm very happy with this
						decision, and after the initial time investment of the
						rewrite, my bet is starting to pay off, allowing me to
						do a lot of things better and more efficiently than I
						otherwise could have.
					</p>

					<p>
						Which brings us to today. In the months since I finished
						rewriting the project, I have added new features,
						refined existing ones and continued my overall work of
						figuring out how to create a multiplayer game that can
						meet my vision. While I'm still working on the technical
						fundamentals (which won't be finished for a while), the
						rough outline of a game is starting to appear in front
						of me. I hope that over the next few months, I can shape
						this project into something that can convey to you what
						I am trying to do. Until then, you will have to contend
						yourself with my vague descriptions, which I plan to
						expand on over the next few newsletters...
					</p>

					<p>
						...unless you are a <a href="/newsletter">newsletter
						subscriber</a>, of course! Newsletter subscribers can
						already try out an early prototype and see the current
						lack of game with their own eyes, in all its
						embarrassing detail.

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						The last month was a slow one. Unfortunately, this thing
						called "money" and my ongoing efforts to obtain some of
						it have required a large amount of my attention.
					</p>

					<p>
						Aside from that, marketing has been on my mind! While
						the project is not nearly ready to actually show to
						people (I show it to <a href="/newsletter">newsletter
						subscribers</a> anyway, against my better judgement),
						I expect I'll need some early testers within the next
						few months. I guess this is as good a time as any to
						start drumming up some attention.
					</p>

					<p>
						The prime example of my marketing efforts is certainly
						this newsletter you're reading right now. I've also
						spent some time to write some <a href="/" target="_blank">sales copy</a>
						to get people to subscribe to the newsletter, but I'm
						not very happy with it. I don't think it gets my point
						across at all. I'm currently working on a replacement,
						which turned out to be a lot of work, but should be
						finished soon, so stay tuned!
					</p>

					<p>
						With all these distractions, not a lot has happened with
						the actual development of the game. I've cleaned up some
						of the game logic code. This will make future work in
						this area much easier, but otherwise doesn't have any
						visible effects. I've also started work on improving my
						development infrastructure. I won't bore you with the
						details, but over the last few months, the time it takes
						for me to be able to test a change that I've made in the
						game has increased a lot, as the project grew bigger and
						more complex. This makes me less effective, of course,
						so any work that improves the situation should pay off
						pretty quickly.
					</p>

					<p>
						By the time the August newsletter arrives, I hope to
						have finished the replacement for the current website
						text and the improvements to my development environment.
						After that, I'll get back into the development of new
						features. I hope to be able to publish a first prototype
						at some point, but right now I have no idea how long
						that will take. One thing is for sure though, you'll
						hear all about it here!

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						Of course, my recent exploits are not the only thing
						that have been happening. Maybe some of the following
						will be of interest to you!
					</p>

					<p>
						Do you know <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/" target="_blank">
						Kerbal Space Program</a>? If you don't, what are you
						still doing here? Go check it out right now! Even if you
						do know it, you probably should check back soon. It
						looks like the guys over at Squad are gearing up for
						the next release and boy, does it look good! Check out
						their
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5UiTqBCNQk" target="_blank">
						latest video</a> for a taste!
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>New Horizons</strong>, the NASA spacecraft that
						launched in 2006,
						<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/14jul_pluto2015/" target="_blank">
						will arrive at Pluto in a year</a>! It's suprising how
						little we know about that little ex-planet, so lots of
						interesting findings are guaranteed.
					</p>

					<p>
						This is certainly not news anymore, but I really like
						<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZC4u0clEc0" target="_blank">
						this video of Huygens landing on Titan in 2005</a>.
						History was made that day!
